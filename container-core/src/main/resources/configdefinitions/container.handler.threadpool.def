## 0 is translated to vcpu*4
## Negative value is interpreted as scale factor ( vcpu*abs(maxThreads) )

## The number of threads to keep in the pool, even if they are idle
## 0 is translated to vcpu*4
## Negative value is interpreted as scale factor ( vcpu*abs(corePoolSize) )

## max queue size
## There can be queueSize + maxthreads requests inflight concurrently
## The container will start replying 503
## Negative value will cause it to set to maxthreads*4

# The max time the container tolerates having no threads available before it shuts down to
# get out of a bad state. This should be set a bit higher than the expected max execution
# time of each request when in a state of overload, i.e about "worst case execution time*2"
