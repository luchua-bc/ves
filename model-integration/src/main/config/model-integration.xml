<!-- Component which can import some ml model.
     This is included into the config server services.xml to enable it to translate
     model pseudo features in ranking expressions during config model building.
     The importers are order by the cost of their probing method, from cheap to expensive.
     It is provided as separate bundles instead of being included in the config model
     because some of these includes
     JNI code, and so can only exist in one instance in the server. -->
