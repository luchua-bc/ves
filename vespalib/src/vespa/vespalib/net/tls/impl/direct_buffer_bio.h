/*
 * Custom BIO implementations which offer direct write/read only buffer
 * access to underlying memory buffers. This removes the need to allocate
 * separate memory BIOs into/from which data is redundantly copied.
 *
 * These BIOs are merely views into buffers that the user must set appropriately
 * before invoking OpenSSL functions that invoke them. The ability to set buffers
 * is only available via scoped guards that cannot be copied or moved.
 *
 * Since no buffer allocation is ever done by these BIOs, it is the responsibility
 * of the caller to provide sufficiently large buffers that OpenSSL operations can
 * make progress.
 *
 * The BIOs ensure that OpenSSL cannot write to read-only buffers and vice versa.
