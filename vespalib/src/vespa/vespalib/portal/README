Portal is the codename of a component that does 3 things:

(1) it is a simple HTTP server able to answer GET requests
(2) it accepts incoming connections from other applications
(3) it establishes outgoing connections to other applications

The idea is that each resource is either something to be queried with
a GET request or something to be connected to with a connection
upgrade similar to how websocket connections are established. This
allows an application to use a single port for all network traffic.

For backwards compatibility, incoming connections can also be accepted
directly from a server socket using a separate port. The important
thing is that the component that will be using the connections is
relieved of the complexities of accepting and establishing them. The
flip to using HTTP connection upgrade later on should requite minor
changes in how the portal API is used.

notable http server limitations:
  * HEAD method not supported
  * http connection keep-alive not supported
  * absolute uri in request-line not supported
