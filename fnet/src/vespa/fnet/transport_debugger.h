/**
 * This class is used to control transport threads during unit
 * testing.
 *
 * The TimeTools created by this class should be used when setting up
 * all transports used in the test. The supplied TimeTools will make
 * sure no thread ever blocks waiting for io-events and also make sure
 * all threads observe the same externally controlled current
 * time. After the transport layers are started, the attach function
 * is used to start controlling event loop execution. While attached,
 * calling the step function will run each transport thread event loop
 * exactly once (in parallel), wait for pending dns resolving, wait
 * for pending tls handshake work and advance the current time (the
 * default 5ms will make sure 'time passes' and 'stuff happens' at a
 * reasonable relative rate). It is important to call detach to
 * release the transports before trying to shut them down.
 *
 * Note that both server and client should be controlled by the same
 * debugger when testing rpc. Using external services will result in
 * (synthetic) time passing too fast compared to stuff actually
 * happening, since you do not control the other end-point in the same
 * way.
 *
 * Take a look at the unit test for this class for an example of how
 * to use it.
