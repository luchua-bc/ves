class FNET_IPacketFactory;

/**
 * This is a convenience class. Large applications may want to
 * implement the functionality offered by this class themselves to
 * obtain better control. A simple but useful implementation of the
 * packet streamer interface. Packets are transmitted with a packet
 * header containing packet length, packet code and channel id. This
 * gives us a total packet header length of 12 bytes. In order to use
 * this packet streamer you must supply an object implementing the
 * packet factory interface to the constructor. The EnsureFree method
 * on the target databuffer is used to ensure that there is enough
 * free space for packets to be encoded. This means that when the
 * packet Encode method is invoked the databuffer has at least as much
 * free space as reported by the packet Length method. After each
 * packet encode/decode the AssertValid databuffer method is run to
 * check for illegal reads/writes.
