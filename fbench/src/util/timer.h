/**
 * This class is used to mesure time intervals, or time spans. In addition to
 * simply measuring timespans, this class also has the ability to set
 * a maximum timespan and use this as a reference when handling
 * measured time spans. The max time span may be thought of as an
 * upper limit for the time spans you are going to measure. After
 * measuring a time span you may use the @ref GetRemaining and @ref
 * GetOvertime methods to check how the measured time span relates to
 * the maximum time span.
