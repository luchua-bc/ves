 * \brief Calculates which buckets correspond to a document selection.
 *
 * When you want to visit a subset of documents in VDS you specify a
 * document selection expression. Some of these expressions limit what
 * buckets may contain matching documents.
 *
 * This class is used to calculate which set of buckets we need to visit
 * to be sure we find all existing data.
 *
 * \see BucketId For more information on buckets
 * \see document::select::Parser For more information about the selection
