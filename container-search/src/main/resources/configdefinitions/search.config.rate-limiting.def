# How much additional capacity to assign to a thread each time it has run out.
# A higher number means less thread contention and less accuracy
capacityIncrement double default=1000

# The max capacity which will ever (and initially) be available to requesting threads on one node
# A higher number means we'll be less sensitive to intermittent overlap
# A good number may be capacityIncrement * 10
maxAvailableCapacity double default=10000

# The probability per request that we check for more quota when we have run out.
# A higher number means less probability of rejecting a request unnecessarily
# but also more thread contention.
# A good number may be 1 / (maxAvailableCapacity * average-cost)
