## This config is used to define load types in VESPA. Load types are merely
## a way to distinguish types of load, as to present such types differently.
## For instance, some metrics will be presented per load type, such that you
## can see how that specific type is being handled. Load types are especially
## useful for separating loads of different priority.

## The identifying index of this type. 0 cannot be used as it is
## reserved for the default type. Other types should be
## non-overlapping from 1 and upwards. No gaps are allowed in the
## index range. (For performance reasons we want to use arrays
## internally where the id is the index)
##
## The identifier is used for efficient transfer of type information.
## The types will be identified by names instead in more textual or
## verbose interfaces.

## The name of a given load type. Each load type must have a unique
## name. The name "default" is reserved for the default type of id 0.
