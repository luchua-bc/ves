## Minutes after midnight when integrity checker is allowed to start running.
## 0 means it will start/continue run at midnight.

## Minutes after midnight when integrity checker is not allowed to run anymore.
## If this equals dailycyclestart it is allowed to run all day. dailycyclestop

## Status of what is allowed done on what weekdays. Should be a string with
## seven characters, where the first represent sunday, the seventh saturday.
## The possible options are RrCc- which means:
##  R - If state becomes R, and current cycle does not verify file content,
##      abort current cycle, otherwise continue it. Start new cycle verifying
##      all content of all files.
##  r - Continue current cycle. Start new cycle using cheap partial file
##      verification.
##  c - Continue current cycle. Dont start a new cycle.

## Max concurrent pending bucket verifications. For max speed, each disk thread
## should have one to work with all the time. Default is 1, to ensure little
## resources are consumed by this process by default. Once request priority
## has been introduced, this default may become higher.
maxpending int default=2

## Minimum time since last cycle before starting a new one in minutes.
## Defaults to 24 hours.
mincycletime int default=1440

## Minimum time in seconds between each request. To throttle the system even
## slower if continuous one pending puts on more load on the system than you
## want. Works with multiple pending messages, though it doesnt make much sense
## unless maxpending equals 1.
