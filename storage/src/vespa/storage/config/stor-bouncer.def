## Whether or not the bouncer should stop external load from

## Sets what node states the node will allow incoming commands
## in.

## If this config value is != -1, the node will reject any external feed
## operations with a priority lower than that specified here. Note that since
## we map priorities in such a way that 0 is the _highest_ priority and 255 the
## _lowest_ priority, for two operations A and B, if B has a lower priority
## than A it will have a higher priority _integer_ value.
##
## Only mutating external feed operations will be blocked. Read-only operations
## and internal operations are always let through.
##
## Default is -1 (i.e. rejection is disabled and load is allowed through)
