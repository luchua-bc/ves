# For any given client visitor operation, this specifies a maximum fan-out

# Having several visitor operations running concurrently increases the

# Minimum number of buckets that have to be present on a given content node
# before more than one visitor operation may be sent in parallel towards it.
# This config is directly related to maxvisitorspernodeperclientvisitor.
# Example: with max visitors of 4, min buckets of 5 and total of 40 buckets on
# a content node, a total of 4 visitors of 10 buckets each will be sent to the
# node. If min buckets were 20, only 2 visitors of 20 buckets each would be
# sent.
