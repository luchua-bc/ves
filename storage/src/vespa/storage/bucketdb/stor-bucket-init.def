# persistence layer. Currently chosen so that such operations will not pre-
# empt any regular external load or ideal state operations, but they will block
# very low priority background operations such as periodic GC (default pri of
# 200). A tradeoff must be made between fast initialization and the availability
# of data on the initializing node.

# starting to read wont make listing wait. However, listing is currently pretty
# much required to be done before starting anyhow, so this option does little
# unless your directories are not hardware independent.
