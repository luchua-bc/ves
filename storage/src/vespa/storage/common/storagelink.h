 * @class storage::StorageLink
 * @ingroup common
 *
 * @brief Base class for StorageServer modules.
 *
 * Base class for StorageServer modules. Each module receives commands from
 * "upstream" and replies from "downstream". It can choose to intercept both
 * these streams via the onDown and onUp methods. The base class methods
 * calls the hooks from MessageHandler. The handlers should return true if the
 * message has been handled and should not be sent to the next module.
 *
 * Replies to messages should not be dispatched from within onDown. Create a
 * separate thread and dispatch messages from this (or use StorageChainQueued).
