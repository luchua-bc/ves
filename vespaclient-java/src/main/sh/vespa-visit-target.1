.SH NAME
vespa-visit-target \- An endpoint for documents visited from a Vespa installation
.SH SYNPOSIS
.B vespa-visit-target
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
When visiting data from Vespa, you might not want to send the data back to the
controlling process. By using separate visitor targets you can divide load
between multiple nodes and have the controlling process run at another location.
The document API has utility classes to set up end points for visitor data from
Vespa. This application is a small tool that uses these utilities and merely
writes the data retrieved to STDOUT in XML format.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
Short options can not currently be concatenated together.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-bindtoslobrok\fR \fISLOBROKADDRESS\fR
Bind to the given slobrok address. Note that the value \fI/visit-destination\fR
will be appended to the given address.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-bindtosocket\fR \fIPORT\fR
Bind to the given TCP socket. This will make sure we listen to the given port.
No slobrok registration is done using this option, so you need to specify
TCP socket address in visitors to get data sent to this destination.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-printids\fR
Using this option, only the document identifiers will be printed to STDOUT.
In addition, if visiting removes, an additional tag will be added so you can
see whether document has been removed or not. This option implies headers only
visiting, and can only be used if no datahandler is specified.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
More verbose output. Indent XML.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Shows a short syntax reminder.
