.SH NAME
vespa-visit \- Visit documents from a Vespa installation
.SH SYNPOSIS
.B vespa-visit
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
In the regular case, retrieve documents stored in VESPA, and either print
them to STDOUT or send them to a given MessageBus route.
.PP
A Vespa visit operation processes a set of stored documents, in undefined
order, locally on the storage nodes where they are stored. A visitor library
available on all storage nodes will receive the documents stored locally, and
can process these and send messages to the visitor data handler. The regular
case is to use the DumpVisitor library to merely send the documents themselves
in blocks back to the data handler, which by default is this client that will
write the documents to STDOUT.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
Short options can not currently be concatenated together.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-selection\fR \fISELECTION\fR
A document selection string, specifying what documents to visit. Documentation
on the language itself can be found in the documentation. Note that this argument
should probably be quoted to prevent your shell from invalidating your
selection.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-from\fR \fITIME\fR
If this option is given, only documents from given timestamp or newer will be
visited. The time is given in microseconds since 1970.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-to\fR \fITIME\fR
If this option is given, only documents up to and including the given timestamp
will be visited. The time is given in microseconds since 1970.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-printids\fR
Using this option, only the document identifiers will be printed to STDOUT.
In addition, if visiting removes, an additional tag will be added so you can
see whether document has been removed or not. This option implies headers only
visiting, and can only be used if no datahandler is specified.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-datahandler\fR \fIVISITTARGET\fR
The data handler is the destination of messages sent from the visitor library.
By default, the data handler is the vespa-visit process you start, which will
merely print all returned data to STDOUT. A visit target can be specified
instead. See the chapter below on visit targets.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-progress\fR \fIFILE\fR
By setting a progress file, current visitor progress will be saved to this
file at regular intervals. If this file exists on startup, the visitor will
continue from this point.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-timeout\fR \fITIMEOUT\fR
Time out the visitor after given number of milliseconds.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-visitremoves\fR
By default, only documents existing in Vespa will be processed. By giving
this option, also entries identifying documents previously existing will
be returned. This is useful for secondary copies of data that wants to know
whether documents it has stored has been removed. Note that documents deleted
a long time ago will no longer be tracked. Vespa keeps remove entries for
a configurable amount of time.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-maxpending\fR \fINUM\fR
Maximum pending docblock messages to data handlers. This may be used to
increase or reduce visiting speed, but should not be set too high so that data
handlers run out of memory. To get an estimate of memory consumption on each
data handler, multiply maxpending with defaultdocblocksize in stor-visitor
config and divide by number of data handlers. Default value for maxpending is
16.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cluster\fR \fICLUSTER\fR
Visit the given VDS cluster.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
More verbose output. Indent XML and add progress and info to STDERR.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Shows a short syntax reminder.
.PP
Advanced options:
.PP
The below options are used for advanced usage or for testing.
.TP
\fB\-\-visitlibrary\fR \fILIBRARY\fR
By default, the DumpVisitor library, sending documents back to the data handler,
is used when visiting. Another library can be specified using this option. The
library filename should be the name given here, with lib prepended and .so
appended.
.TP
\fB\-\-libraryparam\fR \fIKEY\fR \fIVALUE\fR
The default DumpVisitor library has no options to set, but custom libraries
may need user specifiable options. Here such options can be specified. Look
at visitor library documentation for legal parameters.
.TP
\fB\-\-polling\fR \fIarg\fR
The document API implements both a polling and a callback visitor API. The
callback API is most efficient and used by default. The polling API might be
simpler for users used to such APIs. Some VESPA system tests use this option
to test that the polling API works.
.TP
\fB\-\-visitinconsistentbuckets\fR
In some cases Vespa may temporarily be in an inconsistent state, that is,
different nodes contain different copies of the data. Collections of documents
are grouped into so-called buckets. The normal behavior of visiting is to wait
for the inconsistencies to resolve before actually visiting the data. This
might be a problem for time critical applications. Setting this option will
result in the bucket copy with most documents to be visited in case of
inconsistencies, which means that the data returned by the visitor are not
guaranteed to be correct.
.SH VISIT TARGET
Results from visiting can be sent to many different kind of targets.
.TP
\fBMessage bus routes\fR
You can specify a message bus route name directly, and this route will be used
to send the results. This is typically used when doing reprocessing within
Vespa. Message bus routes are set up in the application package. In addition
some routes may have been autogenerated in simple setups, for instance a
route called \fIdefault\fR is generated if your setup is so simple that Vespa
can guess where you want to send your data.
.TP
\fBSlobrok address\fR
You can also specify a slobrok address for data to be sent to. A slobrok address
is a slash separated path where you can use asterisk to mean any element within
this path. For instance, if you have a docproc cluster called \fImydpcluster\fR
it will have registered its nodes with slobrok names like
\fIdocproc/cluster.mydpcluster/docproc/0/feed_processor\fR, where the 0 here
indicates the first node in the cluster. You can thus specify to send visit data
to this docproc cluster by stating a slobrok address of
\fIdocproc/cluster.mydpcluster/docproc/*/feed_processor\fR. Note that this will
not send all the data to one or all the nodes. The data sent from the visitor
will be distributed among the matching nodes, but each message will just be sent
to one node.

Slobrok names may also be used if you use the \fBvespa-visit-target\fR tool to
retrieve the data at some location. If you start vespa-visit-target on two nodes,
listening to slobrok names \fImynode/0/visit-destination\fR and
\fImynode/1/visit-destination\fR you can send the results to these nodes by
specifying \fImynode/*/visit-destination\fR as the data handler. See
\fBman vespa-visit-target\fR for naming conventions used for such targets.
.TP
\fBTCP socket\fR
TCP sockets can also be specified directly. This requires that the endpoint
speaks FNET RPC though. This is typically done, either by using the
\fBvespa-visit-target\fR tool, or by using a visitor destination programmatically
by using utility class in the document API. A socket address looks like the
following: tcp/\fIhostname\fR:\fIport\fR/\fIservicename\fR. For instance, an
address generated by the \fBvespa-visit-target\fR tool might look like the
following: \fItcp/myhost.com:12345/visit-destination\fR.
