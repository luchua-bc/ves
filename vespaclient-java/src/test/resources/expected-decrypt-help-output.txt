usage: vespa-security decrypt <encrypted file> <options>
Decrypts a file using a provided token and a secret private key. The file
must previously have been encrypted using the public key component of the
given private key.

To decrypt the contents of STDIN, specify an input file of '-' (without
the quotes).
 -d,--private-key-dir <arg>    Private key file directory used for
                               automatically looking up private keys based
                               on the key ID specified as part of a token.
 -e,--expected-key-id <arg>    Expected key ID in token. If this is not
                               provided, the key ID is not verified.
 -h,--help                     Show help
 -k,--private-key-file <arg>   Private key file in Base58 encoded format
    --no-interactive           Never ask for private key interactively if
                               no private key file or directory is
                               provided, even if process is running in a
                               console
 -o,--output-file <arg>        Output file for decrypted plaintext.
                               Specify '-' (without the quotes) to write
                               plaintext to STDOUT instead of a file.
 -r,--reseal-request           Delegate private key decryption via an
                               interactive resealing session
 -t,--token <arg>              Token generated when the input file was
                               encrypted
 -z,--zstd-decompress          Decrypted data will be transparently
                               Zstd-decompressed before being output.
