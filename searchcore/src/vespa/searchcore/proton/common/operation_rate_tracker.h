 * Tracks whether the rate (ops/sec) of an operation is above or below a given threshold.

 * When we observe an operation that much time is "spent", and we adjust a threshold time accordingly.
 * If this time is into the future, the current observed rate is above the rate threshold.
 *
 * To avoid the threshold time racing into the future or lagging behind,
 * it is capped in both directions by a time budget window.
