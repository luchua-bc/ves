/**
 * Class that parses URL's and split them into
 * a number of subelements. Detects different types
 * of "URL's", such as http:, https:, ftp:, mailto:,
 * file:, etc. Only http: and https: URL's are
 * processed into smaller subelements. For http: and
 * https: URL's, the parser tries to locate the name
 * of the owner of the domain ('siteowner') by
 * extracting the last word before the TLD from the
 * domain part of the URL. A list of TLD's may be
 * loaded to improve the siteowner extraction algorithm.
 * The class handles relative as well as absolute URL's.
 *
 * Note that memory consumption is quite high for this version,
 * roughly 40kB / instance.
