 * This class is used to calculate the minimal forward and reverse term distance
 * between two terms matching in the same field using the position information for both terms.
 *
 * The terms 'a' and 'b' matching the field 'a b x a' will give the following result:
 *   - forwardDist = 1
 *   - forwardTermPos = 0
 *   - reverseDist = 2
 *   - reverseTermPos = 1
 *
 * Note that if we have a phrase 'a b' and term 'c' matching the field 'a b x c' we will get:
 *   - forwardDist = 2 (between b and c)
 *   - forwardTermPos = 0 (pos of first word)
